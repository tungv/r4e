# Animation Frame

In the previous step, we know that it's only meaningful to refresh to clock as frequently as the screen is refreshed.
But the question is how do we know when the screen can refresh.

With `requestAnimationFrame`, at least we know when the browser wants to refresh.

## `requestAnimationFrame(callback)`

Just like `setTimeout`, `requestAnimationFrame` takes a callback function. That function will be called when the browser wants to refresh.
However, the main difference is that `requestAnimationFrame` will be called at the beginning of the next frame, right before any rendering and painting.
It makes sure that for every frame, the callback will be called at most once. Thus no waistful work will be done.
