# Animated Duration

The benefit of seperating high-level components by state is that now we don't have to do
anything to the `<StopWatchInitital />` component. It's basically static.

Let's think about our `<Duration />` component for a moment.
The duration that should be showing in running state is the
duration since the start of the stopwatch.
Therefore we need to store the `startTime` to calculate that elapsed time.

```
  <Duration durationMs={Date.now() - startTime} />
```

However, reading `Date.now()` in render is not functional, it's an effect.

For effects, we need to use the `useEffect` hook. Consider something like this:

```jsx
function useNow() {
  const [now, setNow] = useState(Date.now());
  useEffect(() => {
    const interval = setInterval(() => setNow(Date.now()), 1000);
    return () => clearInterval(interval);
  }, []);
  return now;
}

function StopWatchRunning({ startTimeMs }) {
  /* ... */
  return (
    <StopWatchLayout>
      /* ... */
      <Duration durationMs={useNow() - startTimeMs} />
      /* ... */
    </StopWatchLayout>
  );
}
```

Try running the above widget and see what happens.
The clock is refreshing too infrequently, at least more than 1 second every tick.
For a precise stopwatch app like ours, we want to be display the milliseconds.
