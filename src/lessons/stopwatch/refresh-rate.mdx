# Refresh Rate

In the previous example, we set the refresh rate to "about" 1 frame per second.
That is too slow. In this step, we will examine how different refresh rates behave.

Let's start the stopwatch above to see a slider to change the refresh rate.
It starts at 1 frame per second (1Hz). You can change the refresh rate by dragging
the slider to the left or right up to 1000Hz.

Changing this slider will change the number of milliseconds in the `setInterval` call.
You think the stopwatch will re-render at the set rate and the more frequent you set,
the more processing power the browser will use?

Not really!

Let's use the Chrome Developer Tools to see how much processing power the browser uses.

As you look the the profiler report, you can see there are 3 primary timers.

1. **The yellow one**: Scripting - this is how much time the browser spends executing scripts.
2. **The purple one**: Rendering - this is how much time the browser spends calculating where to put elements on the screen.
3. **The green one**: Painting - this is how much time the browser spends actually rendering the pixels.

I plotted the three timers above to see how they grow as you request more frames per second.
The one on the left is on my M1 machine.
The one on the right is simulated to be 6x slower on CPU performance.

Surprisingly, the even when you request a higher refresh rate, the scripting time stops growing at about 250Hz,
and the rendering/painting time stop growing at about 100Hz.

That's due to the fact that my monitor can only refresh at 100Hz.
My browser knows it and decides that it's waistful to render and paint more frequently than the monitor can refresh.
Most monitor will refresh at 60Hz, but some can go up to 144Hz. So your mileage may vary.

However, for the scripting time. You will consistently get the maximum time spent at around 250Hz.
This is because `setTimeout` and `setInterval` don't guarantee the callback to be called at the exact time you set it.
They only put your task on the event loop. And the fastest turnaround time to check the loop is about 4ms.

So the question is, how frequent should you render?
