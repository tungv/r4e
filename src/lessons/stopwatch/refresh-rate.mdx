# Refresh Rate

In the previous example, we set the refresh rate to "about" 1 frame per second.
That is too slow. In this step, we will examine how different refresh rates behave.

Let's start the stopwatch above to see a slider to change the refresh rate.
It starts at 1 frame per second (1Hz). You can change the refresh rate by dragging
the slider to the left or right up to 1000Hz.

Changing this slider will change the number of milliseconds in the `setInterval` call.
You think the stopwatch will re-render at the set rate and the more frequent you set,
the more processing power the browser will use?

Not really!

Let's use the Chrome Developer Tools to see how much processing power the browser uses.
